# Repository For The SW3PRJ3 Course

In this course, we created a physical drink mixer controlled by a microcontroller, and an GUI on a Raspberry Pi. This repository contains the GUI made in Python3.9 and SPI kernel module drivers written i C used for communicating between the Raspberry Pi and the microcontroller.

## Setup

The GUI can be run on a windows or UNIX based system. It requires the Pillow library, which can be installed using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager.

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 SPLASH_GUI.py
```
